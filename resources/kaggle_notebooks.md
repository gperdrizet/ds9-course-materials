# Using Kaggle notebooks

Kaggle offers free compute (including some GPU access) via their notebooks feature. See the documentation [here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) for the full details. Kaggle notebooks are a great solution especialy if you are working with a Kaggle dataset. Three main advantages:

Advantages relative to GitHub Codespaces:
1. More powerfull than a dual core GitHub codespace
2. Integreated directly with Kaggle datasets
3. Able to push/pull notebooks from GitHub

Disatavantages relative to GitHub Codespace:
1. Less flexible
2. Limited/no real acces to underlying Linux instance

To illustrate the use of Kaggle notebooks for data science projects, let's walk through setting up the Cats vs Dogs image classifier. These instructions assume you already have a phone number verified Kaggle account.

## 1. Create a new notebook

1. Click your profile icon and select 'Your Work'
2. Click the '+ Create' button and choose 'New Notebook'

You should see a notebook interface with some example code. If you were setting a new project, you could start coding right away.

## 2. Get the notebook from GitHub

1. Click 'File' and select 'Link to GitHub'
2. Follow the prompts to Authorize Kaggle to access your GitHub profile
3. Click 'File', then 'Import Notebook'
